###  **1. CI/CD Cycle with Staging (dev, test, prod)**

**Goal:** Automate the deployment pipeline with three environments.

**Tasks:**

- Define branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow)
    
- Set up CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
    
- Configure staging environments:
    
    - `dev` (continuous integration)
        
    - `test` (manual/automated QA)
        
    - `prod` (release-ready)
        
- Automate environment deployments
    
- Add rollback mechanism
    
- Integration with monitoring/logging tools

### **2. Edge Case Testing for Latency**

**Goal:** Identify latency issues in extreme or unusual conditions.

**Tasks:**

- Simulate low-bandwidth network
    
- Test high packet loss / jitter
    
- Vary geographic locations (VPN or cloud testing tools)
    
- Measure latency under:
    
    - Multiple simultaneous users
        
    - Audio-only / video-only / screen-sharing
        
    - Mobile vs desktop
        
- Benchmark vs baseline

    - Transport tuning (UDP/TCP fallback, bitrate)
        
    - Router and worker configurations
        
    - Simulcast / SVC strategies
        
- Experiment with SFU configurations
    
- Set up latency profiling tools
    
- Review sample projects using Mediasoup
    
- Optimize server placement (edge servers?)

### **4. Producer & Consumer Controls**

**Goal:** Give end-users (musicians) intuitive control over their streams.

**Tasks:**

- Add mute/unmute, volume, device switching
    
- Support for track priority or pausing consumers
    
- Implement audio mix/send controls
    
- Create admin controls (kick, isolate, spotlight)
    
- Handle device permission fallbacks

### **5. UI/UX Optimization**

**Goal:** Collaborate with design team to make UI intuitive for music collab.

**Tasks:**

- Schedule workshop with UI/UX team
    
- Identify high-friction areas in current UI
    
- Collect musician feedback
    
- Prototype improved controls/layouts
    
- Test UI on various screen sizes
    
- Optimize for dark/light modes

**Tasks:**

- Understand existing pipeline architecture
    
- Define integration points
    
- Plan schema and metadata compatibility
    
- Set up shared auth/session management if needed
    
- Test full pipeline integration (e.g., clip export, save session)
